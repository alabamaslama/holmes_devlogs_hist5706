#Sammy's Devlog 2, Week 9: 
In the past few weeks, I have been able to go from being slightly hesitant about an idea I was super passionate about, to now feeling slightly confident I can take on this idea! 

Within Week 7's Devlog, I discussed some of the logistical hurdles that I was worried about hitting in wanting to pursue projection mapping on a government building. I was able to have a meeting with Dr. Graham to go over all of these ideas/worries, and now I am right on track! One of my biggest worries was about the actual practicality of being able to projection map upon a government building. I was operating under the impression that I would be able to bring my project out into the real-world automatically, whereas Dr. Graham slowed me down, and made me realize that even being able to get Mapmap to work on my computer was a big step; actually projecting was a whole other story! Dr. Graham gave me the idea that I could print out a large image of a government building in Ottawa, and I could tape it all over my wall and practice projecting onto this image itself of a building! This idea is amazing because it allows me to fiddle with this technology all in the comforts of my own home, as well as helps me not have to deal with jumping through the hoop of figuring out if projecting on certain buildings is even legal. This also allows me to project at larger capacities than I would actually be able to with the projector I am borrowing; for example, to actually project across a complete building, I would most likely need a few projectors, which could potentially cost $30,000 + dollars, so I am able to provide an example of the potential of projection mapping for historical engagement without having to actually spend that exuberant amount of money. 

The other logistical hurdle that I am still debating is the use of the LGBT Oral History videos that I wanted to project onto these buildings. Although these videos are up on Youtube, I would need to ask for permission from the individual's being interviewed themselves, as well as the LGBT Purge Fund and the associated company that produced these oral history videos, to be able to use them. I could use them in preparing this project for the context of our class, but I wouldn't feel comfortable having used these without having had been able to ask for permission from these speakers themselves. Dr. Graham suggested to me that I could watch a few of these oral histories, and type of transcriptions for these videos, and then record myself speaking out these transcripts, and project this instead. I still feel a little uncomfortable doing this. Another suggestion I received was from Meranda, who suggested that I could run this exercise, where I listen to a few of these interviews, then summarize the experiences that I was told, and then re-tell these summaries using first person. It is an exercise in listening to oral history, and then conveying how you internalized this experience through sharing your own summary. I think I might follow this path, because it feels more ethical to me than completely re-reading these experiences from these speakers. In this way, I can present my final project as a potential of the power of this digital tool in conveying heritage and history, demonstrating that with the support and funding to pursue this project head on, I could then begin to undergo asking for permissions to work with the LGBT Purge to display these oral histories, as well as receive permission to project onto a prominent building. 

In terms of technical improvement, I was able to download Mapmap to my computer a few days ago! I uploaded a few images, just to play with the two different screens.

I haven't gotten a chance to hook up the projector yet, or to print out an image of a building, so hopefully I get a chance to work on this before my next DeVlog!
