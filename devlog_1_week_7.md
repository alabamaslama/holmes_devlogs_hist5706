#Sammy's Devlog 1, November 8 
I can't believe we are already into the part of this course where we are beginning to create our final projects. Is it just me, or did this semester just seem to fly? 

I really don't have a lot to update about, but I have decided on what I would like to pursue as my Final Project! I am really intrigued by the possibilities of Projection Mapping in engaging publics in history in a very immersive, location-based way. I was introduced to the possibility of projection mapping from Dr. Graham himself, when he was discussing a previous class that he taught called Guerilla Digital Public History, which on a side note would have been such a cool course to take! He also pointed me in the direction of a previous students' project, 'Picturing Lebreton Flats' where this student projected an overlay of paintings of the area with an NFB video, and projected this video onto three different sites around Ottawa. I really love the way that projection mapping brings history outside of the institution, and changes the physical capabilities of a space to engage with these historical narratives. 

In my ideal world, I would really love to utilize projection mapping to display oral history videos created by the LGBT Purge Fund onto a government building(s), or a more accessible site, in order to shine light on this somewhat hidden history of discrimination that occurred for decades within the Canadian government and civil services. Here is a link to the oral history videos created in partnership with the LGBT Purge Fund and Know History, which are accessible on Youtube: [text link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEtOz8X1sXEKwYv3pVs5KA)

I think that these videos would be amazing to project because it brings this history and these experiences of discrimination, and reflects it right back onto the institutions and buildings that inflicted this violence. While the oral histories engage listeners in the emotional and impactful experience of the LGBT Purge, projecting these videos onto sites within Ottawa reminds us that this history is not one of the past, but is very present; although the government issued a formal apology and has paid reparations for the LGBT Purge, this does not negate the impact this has left on thousands of people, as well as the continuing discrimination still perpetuated against 2SLGBTQ+ peoples across Canada.  

Although I feel pretty excited about my final project, I am still piecing together the technological knowledge, as well as the pratical implementation of my idea itself. Dr. Graham has pointed me in the direction of readings on AR/VR, as well as the tool mapmap, which I still have to download, and hope to begin working with sometime this week. Dr. Graham graciously has offered for me to borrow a projector that he has, which will be extremely helpful! But, I need to figure out how to access a speaker to bring, since an important part of the oral history videos is in the hearing of their stories. I also don't know the plausibility of projecting onto a government building; I obviously know that I wouldn't be able to project on a building such as Parliament itself, but is there possibly a government building that is not super busy within Ottawa that I could use? Or is there another site that I haven't even thought about that would be really telling to display these videos on? I was also thinking about the possibility of displaying the oral history videos in some capacity close to a war memorial, just to reiterate the silenced histories of these LGBT Purge survivors, and their contributions and dreams within civil service that were cut short simply because of their sexualities.
